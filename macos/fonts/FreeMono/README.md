# What is this?
These are some historical fonts that I was previously using as my daily
driver from ~2016 to late 2022.

The swap is primarily due to getting support for [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts),
which enables me to interpret certain unicode values as icons,
which is pretty nice.
