# What is this?
This repo contains the fonts normally used by me in commandlines and IDEs
from 2022 onwards.

Previously my default font was the FreeMono font from ~2016 ish until now.

# Why do I need this?
The fancy prompt set in /common/colour.symlink uses certain font unicode
points that get resolved into nice icons- we need to use the proper
pre-patched font though that interprets these code points properly, so
we use these fonts here.
